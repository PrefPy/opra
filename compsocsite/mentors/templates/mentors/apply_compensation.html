        <div class="textline"> We currently have funding for a fixed number of paid programming mentors.  Therefore, if you apply for pay, you may be asked to work for credit instead.  Course credit counts as a graded&nbsp;1-credit or&nbsp;2-credit free elective.  In general, if you work an average of&nbsp;1-3&nbsp;hours per week, you will receive 1&nbsp;credit; if you average&nbsp;4&nbsp;or more hours per week, you will receive 2&nbsp;credits.  Note that no more than 4&nbsp;credits may be earned as an undergraduate (spanning all courses and all semesters).  Please do not apply for credit if you have already earned 4 credits as a mentor; apply only for pay.

        <div class="textline">For a paid position, you <strong>must</strong> follow the given instructions to ensure you are paid; otherwise, another candidate will be selected.  More specifically, you will be required to have a <strong>student employment card</strong>.  This requires you to have a federal I-9 on file.  Bring appropriate identification with you to Amos Eaton&nbsp;109 if this is your first time working for RPI; <strong><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents" target="_blank">click here for a list of acceptable documents.</a></strong>  <strong>Note that original documents are required; copies cannot be accepted.</strong>

        <div class="textline">Please note that to be paid, you will be required to submit your specific hours in SIS every two weeks.  This <strong>must</strong> be completed to get paid on time, and any late submissions will incur a fee charged to the department.</div>
        <div class="textline">If you are unable to attend your assigned labs or office hours (e.g., illness, interview, conference, etc.), you <strong>must</strong> notify your graduate lab TA and instructor and help arrange a substitute mentor.  Unexcused absences will cause you to either earn a lower letter grade or not be asked to mentor again.</div>
